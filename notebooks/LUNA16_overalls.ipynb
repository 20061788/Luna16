There are totally 36,378 annotations of nodules that were marked by more than one radiologists, while there are 2,290, 1,602, 1,186, and 777 nodules annotated by at least 1, 2, 3, or 4 radiologists, respectively. Nodules annotated by at least 3 radiologists are regarded as true nodules, whose annotations of diameters and positions are the average of annotation in LIDC-IDRI.\n",
