        "The Luna challenge has been set up by authors of this paper.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. the complete nodule detection track where a complete CAD system should be developed\n",
        "2. the false positive reduction track where a provided set of nodule candidates should be classified\n",

Their main point is that <q>The combination of these solutions achieved an excellent <span title=\"True_Positive/(True_Positive + False_Negative)\">sensitivity</span> of over 95% at fewer than 1.0 false positives per scan.</q>\n",
        "\n",
        "The most interesting fact is that their study observer with four expert readers has shown that the best system detects nodules that were missed by expert readers who originally annotated the <span title=\"The origin of LUNA16 data\">LIDC-IDRI data</span>!\n",

        "###Introduction\n",
        "The original challenge of the real world is that the countries are starting annual chest screening programs, so one major arising challenge is <q>the enormous amount of CT images that must be analyzed by radiologists</q>.\n",

        "The dataset of this challenge is collected from LIDC-IDRI database. To describe LIDC-IDRI, they have written the following in the paper:\n",
        "\n",
        "<q>The LIDC-IDRI database contains a total of 1018 CT scans. CT images come with associated XML files with annotations from four experienced radiologists. The database is very heterogeneous: It consists of clinical dose and low-dose CT scans collected from seven different participating academic institutions, and a wide range of scanner models and acquisition parameters.</q>\n",
        "\n",
        "From the LIDC-IDRI database, they have <q>discarded scans with a slice thickness greater than 3 mm. On top of that, scans with inconsistent slice spacing or missing slices were also excluded</q>.\n",
        "So they finally achieved 888 CT images in .mhd format. They used four radiologists independently to annotate scans and mark all suspicious lesions as: nodule ≥ 3 mm; nodule < 3 mm; non-nodule (as other pulmonary abnormality). They used some policies to merge the lesions wich were annotated by more than one radiologist which is out of this summaries context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Luna was a completely open challenge, so they gave a cross validation recipe that participants should consider not using test data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "They had also 2 challenge tracks which we are not involved in second one, the false positive reduction."
