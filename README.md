# Luna16 object detection
Trying to develop a readable documented repository for Lung Nodule Detection. (Based on the approach of team "[grt123](https://github.com/lfz/DSB2017)" which stood on first place of DSB2017)

Basically I am going through their paper, hence their code (except for their model) was not readable to me at all.

I hope it helps researchers.
If you have any question on the code, please send an [email to me](mailto:s.mostafa.a96@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20LUNA16%20grt123).
